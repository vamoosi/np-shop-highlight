= NP Shop Highlighter ... for 'firefox'
This is foxcapades' np shop highlight extension but finagled to kinda work in firefox. it's not great. i'm not an expert. 
use by downloading the release, going to about:debugging in firefox's url bar, selecting This Firefox, and then uploading the zip as a temporary add-on. fortunately it will remember lists you feed it, but you WILL have to do this every time you close firefox lol
